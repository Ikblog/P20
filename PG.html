    <h1>10 Principles of Graphic Design</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Balance</h2>
    <p>Balance in graphic design refers to the distribution of visual weight across a composition to create stability and harmony in the overall design. This principle involves arranging elements so that no single part of the design overpowers another, creating a sense of equilibrium that feels natural and pleasing to the eye. Balance can be achieved through symmetrical arrangements where elements are mirrored on either side of a central axis, or through asymmetrical balance where different elements of varying visual weights are strategically positioned to create equilibrium. Understanding visual weight involves considering factors such as size, color intensity, texture, and positioning of elements within the composition. Effective use of balance helps guide the viewer's eye through the design in a controlled manner while creating a sense of order and professionalism. Mastering balance is essential for creating designs that feel stable, trustworthy, and visually appealing across all types of graphic design applications.</p>
    
    <h3>Daily Life Applications:</h3>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Emphasis</h2>
    <p>Emphasis is the principle of creating focal points within a design to draw attention to the most important elements and establish a clear visual hierarchy. This principle involves making certain elements more prominent than others through strategic use of size, color, positioning, contrast, or unique styling to guide the viewer's eye and communicate priorities effectively. Emphasis helps prevent designs from becoming visually confusing by clearly indicating where viewers should focus their attention first, second, and so on throughout the composition. The principle can be achieved through various techniques including isolation, where important elements are surrounded by white space, or through the use of directional elements that point toward key information. Effective emphasis ensures that the main message or call-to-action is immediately apparent to viewers, improving communication effectiveness and user experience. Understanding emphasis is essential for creating designs that successfully capture attention, convey important information, and motivate desired actions from the target audience.</p>
    
    <h3>Daily Life Applications:</h3>
